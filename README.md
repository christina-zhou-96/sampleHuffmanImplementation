This is a great example of a compression algorithm. Walk through it with your debugger step by step to understand it better. The trick behind it is to find the frequency of symbols in your data, and to give your data that is more frequent shorter codes and your data that is less frequent longer codes. (Sort of like Scrabble.) This efficiently compresses your data, but doesn't lose any information - hence it's a lossless algorithm. Code co-written with ChatGPT4.

The algorithm uses a binary tree structure, called a Huffman tree, to represent the symbols and their associated codes. Here's a high-level overview of the algorithm:

Count the frequency of each symbol in the data.
Create a list of nodes, each containing a symbol and its frequency.
While there is more than one node in the list:
a. Select the two nodes with the lowest frequencies.
b. Create a new node with the sum of the frequencies of the two selected nodes as its frequency.
c. Add the new node to the list and remove the two selected nodes.
d. Assign binary codes to the nodes in the tree by traversing it (0 for the left branch, 1 for the right branch).
Create a dictionary that maps symbols to their binary codes.
Encode the data using the dictionary.
